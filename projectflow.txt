1. create a git repo and clone it in local
2. Create mycode.py and add code to it. ( it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do a git add-commit-push before intializing dvc/\.
# pip install dvc
4. How we do "dvc init" (create .dvcignore, .dvc)
5. Now do "mkdir s3" (creates a new S3 directory)
6. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote s3" 
7. Next "dvc add data/" 
   Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
   Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
